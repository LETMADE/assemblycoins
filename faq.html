  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h4>What is the difference between transferring and issuing coins?</h4>
  <p>
    Issuing coins means creating new coins from thin air.  Only the the issuing Bitcoin address, which fundamentally controls the assets, may issue new coins.  If another address attempts to issue that same coin color, it will be invalid.
    <br><br>Transferring coins means to move existing coins to another address.
