  <h2>Introducing Assembly Assets</h2>
  <p>
    Assembly Assets is a decentralized protocol and functioning API for representing and managing assets. An Assembly Asset Coin lets you represent just about anything, from karma to ownership in a business, in a completely transparent, secure, and liquid way. You can mint a new Assembly Asset Coin by using the API, supplying a name and total amount of Assembly Asset Coins in circulation. These newly minted coins can then be transferred from one Bitcoin address to another, irrespective of the underlying Bitcoin currency value. In the future we also plan to support other capabilities like trust-less voting and distributing dividends in BTC to an Assembly Asset Coin owners.
  </p>
  <p>
    An Assembly Asset Coin is not an alt-coin with its own separate blockchain. Instead each Assembly Asset Coin is a new trustless metacoin on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. This means the data recording asset ownership is much more secure and enduring than a newly invented, seldom used, parallel blockchain. There is no intermediary between you and an Assembly Asset. There is no premining, no presale, and there is no internal currency with a separate Bitcoin exchange rate.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an open protocol and completely open-sourced API with no barriers to entry. If you like it, fork it and make it better.

  <h2>The Assembly Asset Protocol</h2>
  <p>
    Assembly Assets is a specific implementation of the colored coin concept, which has been around for some time in the Bitcoin community. While colored coins are a general concept with several groups working on their features, Assembly Assets is a specific implementation of the colored coin concept. It extends the nascent [Open Assets] protocol(https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol/blob/master/specification.mediawiki).  Assembly Asset Coins inherits from colored coins, which are of wide-ranging purpose, and applies them to a particular use case. Assets besides bitcoins can now be represented as abstractions on the Bitcoin Blockchain using Assembly Assets.  Whereas bitcoins natively are indistinguishable from one another, Assembly Assets are distinguishable abstractions represented on the Bitcoin Blockchain, consisting of more than just Satoshi.  Assembly Assets have been specially labelled/watermarked in such a way that they retain that label/watermarked through all subsequent transactions.  They come in quantities which may not coincide with their value in Satoshi.  And they come labelled/watermarked with their ‘issuing address’, which states the ‘identity’ or ‘type’ of each Assembly Asset coin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assembly Asset Coins are a powerful concept for several reasons.  Because they exist on the Bitcoin Blockchain, they enjoy all the benefits therein.
    <ul>
    <li>Assembly Asset Coins can represent a wide variety of items enabling new services to be designed around the transparency of their ownership.</li>
    <li>Assembly Asset Coins can be easily transferred from one address to another, quickly and at low cost.  Ownership has never has never been so easy to move around.</li>
    <li>Assembly Asset Coins provide proof-of-ownership of whatever they represent.  This opens doors for other uses not appropriate to Bitcoin, such as voting.</li>
    <li>Assembly Asset Coins are trustless once minted.  While the issuer of a particular Assembly Asset Coin must be trusted, the transmission and ownership of Assembly Asset Coins are not susceptible to any third parties.</li>
    <li>Assembly Asset Coin will be secure; it will be cryptographically impossible to forge a transaction from the private key holder.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Because AssemblyCoins inherits from colored coins, our API will be designed for the most general use of colored coins.  A user should be able to manipulate all Open Assets-compliant colored coins with Assembly tools.  Conversely, it should not be obligatory to use Assembly's API to manage AssemblyCoins.  We hold no unique information; it's all on the Blockchain.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Assembly built Assembly Assets</h2>
  <p>
    At Assembly, we provide an environment for individuals to collaborate on products from around the world. As members make contributions to specific tasks, called bounties, they earn ownership in the corresponding product. This ownership is represented by an unique Assembly Asset Coin for that product. If and when the product later makes money, its profits are distributed as royalties to Coinholders proportionately. Payments are issued monthly as long as the product remains profitable.
  </p>
  <p>
Assembly contributors are already receiving regular, monthly cash payments from profitable products. As members get paid, we are working to expand their capabilities as owners. While we currently store all product information on our servers, we are excited about the potential of blockchain-based technologies in revolutionizing digital ownership. As a platform where members create companies, Assembly is well-placed to reinvent the way businesses are built. This means innovating in finance as well as software. We see decentralizing the instruments of ownership as the next big step forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assembly uses Assembly Assets to putt members' ownership in individual products on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Assembly Asset Coins are digital ownership tokens with all the advantages of Bitcoin and none of the currency risk. We aim to give members the best tools, extending to cryptographic guarantees of control, such that ownership is no longer a matter of trust, but mathematically self-evident. Satoshi's central innovation of proof-of-work and decentralization has a lot more potential than has so far been implemented. We are building Bitcoin 2.0 tools that utilize new aspects of the Blockchain beyond currency. As a site where members contribute digitally and own assets digitally, Assembly is an ideal platform to capitalize on the latest developments in cryptocurrency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Assembly Assets is an open protocol which we are using to enhance the Assembly platform's value for our users. There is no premining, no presale. There is no internal currency with a separate Bitcoin exchange rate. There is no intermediary between you and Assembly Assets. Because our sole incentive is the maximize the experience of our members, we approached the design of ownership crypto-representation so as to produce the most sensible tool and not necessarily the most profitable one. This stands in stark contrast to many other 'Bitcoin 2.0' technologies out there, designed from the bottom up to raise money before real work gets done. Assembly products already make money, so Assembly Asset Coins themselves will immediately have value based on real-world revenue streams.
  </p>


  <h2>Our Vision of the Future</h2>
  <p>
    Assembly already innovates in the way products are built. By connecting makers from all over the world, and incentivizing them with ownership stakes in future profits, new types of businesses can be built on our platform.  But we want to go further.  Assembly intends to challenge the status quo in finance by distributing ownership via liberating technologies such as cryptocurrency.  We want to remove barriers to economic participation in profit-seeking enterprises.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assembly wants to be the financial clearinghouse that simplifies life for disparate, product-oriented developers and designers.  This means getting out of your way and putting the best tools in your hands.  The hassles of incorporating a startup and keeping track of paperwork should be minimized as much as possible.  We handle a lot of the obstacles to executing a cool new idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    While trust is critical in doing business, in practice, it is currently a very expensive thing to acquire.  Assembly wants to square the circle and deliver you that trust via ironclad cryptographic tools, which, we believe, are the way business will be done in the future.  Assurances that would require complicated legal frameworks will be obviated by elegantly complete mathematics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our vision of the future is one in which companies are transparently managed, fluidly created, disbursements are easy, paperwork is automated.  Let lawyers and accountants be redundant!  The friction that ordinarily interferes with the fruition of a great idea should be reduced as much as possible.  Your ownership will be cryptographic, which means undisputed by the awesome power of math. Decisions too, and money handling, the day-to-day of business, while easy to use on the front end, are underlied by strong cryptographic guarantees.  If anyone wants to peak under the hood, audit a company, poll the stakeholders, go over the entire financial history, it should be as trivial as clicking a button.
  </p>


  <h2>Assembly Assets on Assembly</h2>
  <p>
    While anyone can make use of the Assembly Assets protocol for virtually any purpose, freely transfering coins from one individual to another, the Assembly platform has some restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each Assembly product is a partnership in which members have contributed work and thereby receive ownership.  That ownership will be represented by Assembly Asset Coins. Profit distributions are royalties from individual products.  Coinholders may transfer their assets between addresses they control, or between existing stakeholders in the partnership.  Tax information must be registered, for withholding purposes, for each US residents and foreign members.  Each AssemblyCoins revenue stream can thus be associated with a member's tax information for IRS compliance. Payments in Bitcoin will be reported as with USD dollars.  Because Assembly Asset Coins represent partnership stakes, Coinholders must exercise partners' responsibilities, such as participating in products at least once a year.
  </p>
