        <p>
          Create any asset token you want and rest
          assured it cannot be forged.  Prove that you have
          10,000 Karma Points, or trade Refrigerator-Real-Estate-Coins with
          your roommate.  It's up to you!  Whatever you represent, it's all on the Blockchain and it's all provable.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Assembly, we are using cryptocurrencies to represent ownership in products built on our platform. Since our products already make money, Product Coins will immediately have value.  We want to use the Blockchain to give owners new, more powerful tools to run businesses trustlessly from around the world.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="text-center text-teal">How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          Assembly Coins is an API and protocol that works by writing information on the Bitcoin Blockchain to express
          ownership of different kinds of assets.  Because its written on Bitcoin, it is highly secure and long-lasting; we are
          using an existing infrastructure that already works.
        </p>
        <p>Use our <a href="#">open source API</a>, or <a href="#">fork it for yourself</a>.  We don't control any proprietary information.  Everything's
          open source and on the Blockchain.

        <ul>
          <li>Nothing is kept serverside that can't be derived from the Bitcoin Blockchain</li>
          <li>No Premine, No Presale, No separate Blockchain, No Alt-Coin intermediary currency.</li>
          <li>We're not searching for use cases, we already have them.  Assembly Products already make money.  So their ownership coins will have immediate real-world value.</li>
          <li>The only actually legal crypto-ownership schema.  We have actually done our research.</li>

  <h1 class="text-center">FAQ</h1>
  <br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4>If this isn't an altcoin, where do Assembly Coins exist?</h4>
      <p>Assembly Coins are metacoins, written as an abstract layer on top of Bitcoin.  Imagine labelling pennies so they had special meaning.  That's what we've done, except we've labeled small quantities of Bitcoin.  </p>

      <h4>What is the difference between transferring and issuing coins?</h4>
      <p>Issuing coins means creating new coins from thin air.  Only the the issuing Bitcoin address, which fundamentally controls the assets, may issue new coins.  If another address attempts to issue that same coin color, it will be invalid. Transferring coins means to move existing coins to another address.
      </p>

      <h4>What happens if I spend my colored coins as regular Bitcoin?</h4>
      <p>In this case, you render the Colored Coins unspendable.  We will still recognize you as owning colored coins, but they will become immobile.  Don't spend your Colored Coins as Bitcoin!</p>

      <h4>How is this better than MasterCoin/Counterparty/NXT?</h4>
      <p>Assembly Coins exist on the Bitcoin Blockchain. While Counterparty, MasterCoin, and NXT all give digital-token capabilities, they all require the use of separate altcoins, which have had presales to enrich their creators.  So to use any of these separate systems, one must transact into a separate currency before then manipulating digital tokens.  This separate currency is an unfortunate barrier.  Assets, even within the cryptocurrency space, suffer price volatility from the exchange rate of MasterCoin versus Bitcoin, etc. This is an unnecessary headache.  While the creation of these separate altcoins was a convenient design decision for their creators, they do not offer the optimal solution to users.</p>
      <p>Additionally, because we write Colored Coin information on the Bitcoin Blockchain, and not a less-popular one such as DogeCoin, we better insure the longevity and security of potentially important information. Putting ownership on a lesser altcoin would not be a responsible or enduring way to records ownership.</p>

      <h4>How much does this cost?</h4>
      <p>You must pay for the Bitcoin transaction fees as defined by the Bitcoin network.  We also charge a small fee for using the Assembly Assets API on a per-issuance basis.  In other words, to create a new coin, we charge a very small fee. There is nothing intrinsically mandatory about this, however, because users may fork our open-source code and remove the fee requirement, if they so choose.</p>
      <p>There is no presale, no premine, no catch.  We didn't design this to make money on its own.  We built it to support ownership of Products on Assembly.  Insofar as it may be used for other, non-Assembly-related applications, so much the better.</p>
    </div><!-- .col-md-6 -->

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4>How much Bitcoin do I need to create or transfer coins?</h4>
      <p>You need trace amounts of Bitcoin to create or transfer colored coins.  Basically the transaction fees, as defined by miners on the Bitcoin network, and dust. In practice this amounts to approximately 0.00005 BTC for transfers and 0.002 for declarations of new coins (longer declarations cost more).  Any address issuing or transferring Colored Coins via this API must have the requisite amounts of regular bitcoin in it, or it will fail.</p>

      <h4>How does this scale?</h4>
      <p>Assembly Coins monitors Open Assets-compliant transactions and records this in a database.  This is necessary because colored coin transactions can be imitated if they are not traced back to the originating issuing address.</p>

      <p>We are working on a client-side version that may allow partial backtracing.  For example, as with Bitcoin, where a full wallet client must parse through the entire Blockchain to verify the legitimacy of unspent outputs directed at its address, a client-side version that backtraced transactions directed at itself would improve scaleability for powerusers.  For normal users, Assembly Assets does the work of monitoring the Blockchain, much as Blockchain.info does for Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Everything we do is open-source, so users are free to build their own databases to independently verify assets themselves.</p>

      <h4>Is the use of Assembly Coins legal as it represents ownership of profit-making Assembly Products?</h4>
      <p>Assembly Coins can be used for any purpose independent of Assembly.  However, as they pertain to Assembly Products, which distribute royalties to stakeholders, there are certain restrictions in compliance with regulations.  Only partners may hold Coins representing Products on Assembly. Each revenue stream is associated with a particular partner, from which we withhold taxes as mandated by the IRS.  While partners may transfer their ownership between addresses, we ask that they not transfer ownership to non-partners, again, in compliance with federal regulations.  This is in keeping with the definition of products on Assembly as partnerships, and not publicly tradeable financial instruments.</p>
      <p>Users who use the Assembly Coin=s API for other purposes need not consider the above advisement, which pertains only to products on Assembly, but should consult their own local laws on a case-by-case basis.</p>
