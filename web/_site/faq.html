  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <br>
  <h4>
    Can I manipulate Assembly Coins client-side?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Yes.  All the information is secure on
    the Blockchain.  Since AssemblyCoins is
     an open source service, you can
    run it yourself.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>
    Do I need to burn Bitcoin?
  </h4>
  <p>
    No.  Don't burn Bitcoin!  Dust amounts
    of Bitcoin are needed for transactions,
     that's all.  They're not lost either.
  </p>

  <br><h4>What is the difference between transferring and issuing coins?</h4>
  <p>
    Issuing coins means creating new coins from thin air.  Only the the issuing Bitcoin address, which fundamentally controls the assets, may issue new coins.  If another address attempts to issue that same coin color, it will be invalid.
    <br><br>Transferring coins means to move existing coins to another address.
  </p>
  <br><h4>How much Bitcoin do I need to create or transfer coins?</h4>
  <p>
    You need trace amounts of Bitcoin to create or transfer colored coins.  Basically the transaction fees, as defined by miners on the Bitcoin network, and dust.  Any
    address issuing or transferring Colored Coins via this API must have the requisite amounts of regular bitcoin in it, or it will fail.
  </p>
  <br><h4>What happens if I spend my colored coins as regular Bitcoin?</h4>
  <p>In this case, you render the Colored Coins unspendable.  We will still recognize you as owning colored coins, but they will become immobile.  Don't spend your Colored Coins as Bitcoin!</p>

  <br><h4>How is this better than MasterCoin/Counterparty/NXT?</h4>
  <p>
    Assembly Coins, and Colored Coins generally, exist on the Bitcoin Blockchain.  While Counterparty, MasterCoin, and NXT all give digital-token capabilities, they all require the use of separate altcoins, which
    have had presales to enrich their creators.  So to use any of these separate systems, one must transact into a separate currency before then manipulating digital tokens.  This separate currency is an unfortunate
     barrier.  Assets, even within the cryptocurrency space, suffer price volatility from the exchange rate of MasterCoin versus Bitcoin, etc.  This is an unnecessary headache.  While the creation of these separate altcoins
     was a convenient design decision for their creators, they do not offer the optimal solution to users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, because we write Colored Coin information on the Bitcoin Blockchain, and not a less-popular one such as DogeCoin, we better insure the longevity and security of potentially important financial
    information.  Putting ownership on a lesser altcoin would not be a responsible or enduring way to records ownership.
  </p>

  <br><h4>How does this scale?</h4>
  <p>
    Assembly Coins monitors Open Assets-compliant transactions and records this in a database.  This is necessary because colored coin transactions can be imitated if they are not traced back to the
     originating issuing address.

     We are working on a client-side version that may allow partial backtracing.  For example, as with Bitcoin, where a full wallet client must parse through the entire Blockchain to verify the legitimacy of unspent outputs directed
     at its address, a client-side version that backtraced transactions directed at itself would improve scaleability for powerusers.  For normal users, Assembly Coins does the work of monitoring the Blockchain, much as Blockchain.info does for Bitcoin.

     Everything we do is open-source, so users are free to build their own databases to independently verify assets themselves.
  </p>

  <br><h4>How much does this cost?</h4>
  <p>
    You must pay for the Bitcoin transaction fees as defined by the Bitcoin network.  We also charge a small fee for using the Assembly Coins API on a per-issuance basis.  In other words, to create a new coin, we charge a very small
    fee.  There is nothing intrinsically mandatory about this, however, because users may fork our open-source code and remove the fee requirement, if they so choose.

    There is no presale, no premine, no catch.  We didn't design this to make money on its own.  We built it to support ownership of Products on Assembly.  Insofar as it may be used for other, non-Assembly-related applications, so much the better.
  </p>

  <br><h4>Is the use of Assembly Coins legal as it represents ownership of profit-making Assembly Products?</h4>
  <p>
    Assembly Coins can be used for any purpose independent of Assembly.  However, as they pertain to Assembly Products, which distribute royalties to stakeholders, there are certain restrictions in compliance with regulations.  Only partners may hold
    Coins representing Products on Assembly.  Each revenue stream is associated with a particular partner, from which we withhold taxes as mandated by the IRS.  While partners may transfer their ownership between addresses, we ask that they not transfer ownership
    to non-partners, again, in compliance with federal regulations.  This is in keeping with the definition of products on Assembly as partnerships, and not publicly tradeable financial instruments.

    Users who use the Assembly Coins API for other purposes need not consider the above advisement, which pertains only to products on Assembly, but should consult their own local laws on a case-by-case basis.
