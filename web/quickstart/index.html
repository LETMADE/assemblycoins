<p>
  This guide is going to get you up and running with Assembly Coins with the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#issue-a-new-coin">Issue a new coin</a></li>
  <li><a href="#transfer-coins-to-your-wallet">Transfer coins to your wallet</a></li>
  <li><a href="#check-your-coin-balance">Check your coin balance</a></li>
</ol>


<h2 id="issue-a-new-coin">1. Issue a new coin</h2>

<p>
  Specify some details about your new Asset class. All of this metadata will be encoded on the Bitcoin Blockchain, with the exception of your email address. Your <code>email</code> is used to alert you when the coin is ready for transfer.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl https://coins.assembly.com/v1/colors/prepare \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ \
        "coin_name": "snapcat", \
        "issued_amount": 10000000, \
        "description": "Self-destructing images of cats", \
        "email": "jane@example.com" \
      }'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This will return a response like looks like:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "name": "snapcat",
  "issuing_private_key": "5KUABpsoZKMqpvm3yFe9Zg52QX3XY8Xw8pa4ntuK7SBdVt7CkrK",
  "minting_fee": "0.0004",
  "issuing_public_address": "1EmnqhfvjcAdA71gs2exugXkgHrJw9QcuA"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You now need to send the <code>minting_fee</code> amount to the <code>issuing_public_address</code>. For the example above, you would need to send 0.0004 BTC to <code>1EmnqhfvjcAdA71gs2exugXkgHrJw9QcuA</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This small amount of Bitcoin must be sent to the issuing address to pay for miner fees and processing. After your Bitcoin has arrived, a series of transactions will be written for you. These transactions will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write a multipart statement on the Bitcoin Blockchain declaring your intent.</li>
  <li>Write an Open Assets issuing transaction to back to the issuing address. You can transfer existing coins later.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Your new coin now lives on the blockchain!
</p>



<h2 id="transfer-coins-to-your-wallet">2. Transfer coins to your wallet</h2>

<p>
  You still have full control over the issuing address because you are given a private key in step 1, however, for added security you may want to transfer the coins to a wallet that you control. This transactions will be signed serverside.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ curl https://coins.assembly.com/v1/transactions/transfer \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d `{ \
        "from_public_address": "1EmnqhfvjcAdA71gs2exugXkgHrJw9QcuA", \
        "from_private_key": "5KUABpsoZKMqpvm3yFe9Zg52QX3XY8Xw8pa4ntuK7SBdVt7CkrK", \
        "transfer_amount": 10, \
        "source_address": "1EmnqhfvjcAdA71gs2exugXkgHrJw9QcuA", \
        "fee_each": 0.00005, \
        "to_public_address": "YOUR WALLETS ADDRESS", \
        "callback_url": "https://example.com" \
      }`
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The <code>from_public_address</code> &amp; <code>from_private_key</code> are the address and private key of the issuing address from step 1. For this initial transfer, the <code>source_address</code> is also the <code>from_public_address</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This command queues the transaction to be processed. It can take several minutes to be fully recognized by the blockchain. The command will return immediately but if you specify the <code>callback_url</code> parameter, you will receive a JSON POST with more specific transaction hash information once the transaction has been processed.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{"result": "Queued"}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Once that transaction has processed you'll be the prod owner of 10 snapcat coins!
</p>

<h2 id="check-your-coin-balance">3. Check your coin balance</h2>

<p>
  Now for the easy part. Lets inspect your wallet and see what coins it contains:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl https://coins.assembly.com/v1/addresses/1BHjGfCcEY1uJMJsHRJDXBdSeo5SbqcHcz
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Replace the last part of the URL with your own address and you should get a response like:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "transaction_hash": "43d7a109b9df16e131e358922b492dd68e19964c87d0df6cf6f396ba8a973926",
  "color_address":3CPJdTm94NdGnSAcnZnnmLanGcg2V3NpX8"",
  "block": 320000
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Now you're ready to start diving into the full <a href="/docs">API documentation</a> and building your own apps using Assembly Coins!
